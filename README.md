# Processor-Verilog

This project is a simple Processor with 9 ALU operations,

Memory and decoding and timing and all that to come ...

This project includes Python for building the project and running all tests where the output text file is compared
against an expected output. 

Subtest output can be conditional shown for debugging purposed by changing the config file.

Simply run test.py

Here is a screenshot of all tests for the ALU
